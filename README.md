# Unaty Entity Defintions
Standardized data for elements of online community building are essential to building a more interconnected and compatible future tools. 

This Repository contains full data defintions around what we consider to be the important building blocks of a community including members, roles, groups, posts, feeds, member types, segments, and notifications.

## Purpose
Community life should be about people coming together around a shared purpose. Be it making a positive impact, playing a sport together, connecting like-minded people - or just having fun, Communities are a part of a healthy and fulfilling life for all of us.

Keeping a Community organized is a lot of work and can be easily overwhelming. Community life is mostly voluntary and budgets for tools and staff are nowhere near private companies - nor should they have to be! We set out to make Community life easier to organize for leaders and more enjoyable for members. 

### Our mission is to help anyone build Community, without the busywork.

To accomplish this, we set out to build Unaty, a better app for decentralized Community management.

The core of Unaty is similar to a CRM tailor-made for communities for robust data management and definitions around member data and community structures. Unaty is built to effectively manage people entities like members, groups, segments, and member types. These can often be used in combination to make organizing members easier. For example, instead of individually sending an email to 90 members, you can simply choose to send to all members living in Germany. Or send a message to all Alumni (member type).

Leader/Member/App communication is an essential part of building a decentralized tool for Community management. Currently Unaty is built around email as the primary method to enable this integration, which is reflected by a rich mailing list, posts, and content integration.

Unaty also has definitions around core content entities like posts and events and enables leaders to send messages directly to members through Email with content also saved as posts within the tool.

## Principles
* Build the best member data management tool to create a golden source of data for communities.
* Build and structure data entities around reusable specs to enable easier integration.
* Build generalized community solutions into the core platform, functionality specific to certain types of Communities like Tournaments, Fundraising, or counting the number of fish caught by members in a year is something that can be built later by communities themselves.
* It should be easy to import, merge, and export data so it's always easy to use the best-in-class tool for the job.

## Examples
Events: Similar to files, while we can't build a better solution than Box or Dropbox, Unaty will have support to create events within communities and include basic functionality like attendee management, since this builds directly on top of leveraging entities to add the right people to events. It will then be easy to create events also through an API, export those to another app, and also integrate other apps for richer event management as needed.

Tasks: This is not an area we believe to be core to community management and something better served by the wide array of productivity tools available. Future integrations will be possible to more easily create tasks and basic operations.
Payments: A deeper integration enabling simple payments will be possible in the mid-term.
Events/Drive: Unaty has strong core support for these content types with tools to create and manage. Ease-of-use through the API and other richer apps will provide advanced functionality as needed in the future. 
Specialty (Tournaments): Communities can build themselves leveraging data from Unaty and building richer integrations in the future.
